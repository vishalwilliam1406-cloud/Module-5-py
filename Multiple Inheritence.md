# Arithmetic Operations Using Multiple Inheritance in Python

This Python program demonstrates **multiple inheritance** by performing basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, and Division — using three classes.

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program to calculate **Add, Sub & Division** using **Multiple Inheritance**.

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Define `Calculation1` class**
   - Contains `Summation(a, b)` method to return the sum of two numbers.
2. **Define `Calculation2` class**
   - Contains `Subtraction(a, b)` method to return the difference of two numbers.
3. **Define `Derived` class**
   - Inherits from both `Calculation1` and `Calculation2`.
   - Contains `Division(a, b)` method to return the division result.
4. **Input**
   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
5. **Process**
   - Create an object of the `Derived` class.
   - Call `Summation`, `Subtraction`, and `Division` methods.
6. **Output**
   - Display the results of the three operations.

## 💻 Program 
```
   class Calculation1:
  def Addition(self):
       return self.a + self.b
class Calculation2:
  def Subraction(self):
       return self.a - self.b
class Derived(Calculation1,Calculation2):
  def __init__(self,a,b):
      self.a = a
      self.b =b
  def Division(self):
      return self.a / self.b
a  = int(input("Enter Number-1 : "))
b = int(input("Enter Number-2 : "))
derived = Derived(a,b)
print("Addition of given two number is",derived.Addition())
print("Subraction of given two number is",derived.Subraction())
print("Division of given two number is",derived.Division())
```
